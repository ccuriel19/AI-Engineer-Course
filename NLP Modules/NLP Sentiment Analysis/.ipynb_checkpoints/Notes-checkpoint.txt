Sentiment Analysis - NLP technique for discovering the underlying emotional tone of text
    Positive Sentiment - Expression of liking something, enjoyment, positive emotion
    Negative Sentiment - Expression of negative emotion
    Neutral Sentiment - Sentence is neither positive not negative - "It was raining"

EXAMPLE:
sentence_1 = "i had a great time at the movie if was really funny"
sentence_2 = "i had a great time at the movie but the parking was terrible"
sentence_3 = "i had a great time at the movie but the parking wasn't great"
sentence_4 = "i went to see a movie"

Using TextBlob:
sentiment_score_1 = TextBlob(sentence_1)
print(sentiment_score_1.polarity) --> 0.525 [POSITIVE*]

* Anything > 0 means it has a positive sentiment

Using Vader:

print(vader_sentiment.polarity_scores(sentence_1))
i had a great time at the movie if was really funny
{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.578, 'pos': 0.422, 'compound': 0.807} --> shows all diff sentiments and compound aka overall score

* The closer to 1 the more positive and the closer to -1 the more negative
